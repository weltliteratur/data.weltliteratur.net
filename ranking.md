# overview

Top 25 writers on 15 different language versions of Wikipedia, ranked by the following measures:

- [page length](#page-length)
- [number of in-links](#number-of-in-links)
- [PageRank writers](#pagerank-writers)
- [PageRank complete](#pagerank-complete)
- [page views 2012](#page-views-2012)
- [page views 2013](#page-views-2013)
- [page views 2014](#page-views-2014)

Names in **bold** indicate *native* writers, i.e., writers that have
(mainly) written in the corresponding language. Operationalization
led to some contingent decisions, or, to quote our paper
(**[preprint here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00991)**),
"declaring *Virgil* and *Cicero* ‘Italian’ writers was probably the
most daring intervention when operationalizing our data"
(so yes, we're aware ;-). The *mean* row shows
the mean number of native writers (over all 15 languages) per
rank. The *count* column shows the number (and percentage) of native
writers among the top 25 for each language.

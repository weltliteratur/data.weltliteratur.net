# overview

The top 25 *native* writers of each language (i.e., writers that have
mainly written in that language) that appear most often among the
[top 25 writers](ranking.html) of the other 14 languages in each of
the following rankings:

- [page length](#page-length)
- [number of in-links](#number-of-in-links)
- [PageRank writers](#pagerank-writers)
- [PageRank complete](#pagerank-complete)
- [page views 2012](#page-views-2012)
- [page views 2013](#page-views-2013)
- [page views 2014](#page-views-2014)

The writers are ranked by the sum of the reciprocal ranks which is
displayed after the name of each writer. Not all languages contain 25
native writers, since for these language less than 25 writers appeared
among 25 writers of the other 14 languages (for the corresponding
ranking measure).
